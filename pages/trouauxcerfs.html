        Situated around 605m above sea level in the district of Plaine Wilhems, in the beautiful town of Curepipe, the Trou Aux Cerfs is the most famous volcano on our island. In the early 1800s, Trou Aux Cerfs was called Tronc Aux Cerfs on some documents. Some reports describe many deers wandering inside the crater, giving us the origin of the name.

        It is classified as a dormant volcano, constitutes a crater lake, and has dense shrubs and trees. The crater's diameter is approximately 350m, and the central depression depth is about 85m. Decades ago, at the bottom of the crater, there were vineyards and plantations managed by the Botanist Lavignac. He even wanted to build his house inside. Some Malagasy slaves used to live nearby as well.

        Nowadays, lots of joggers and enthusiasts frequent the place, which turned it great for sightseeing, The tracks to descend to the crater are not that easy. One of them is very complicated due to the dense shrubs and trees. The other track is slippery in rainy weather, hence, muddy and still surrounded by thorny bushes. Some people fish in the lake. The vineyards do not exist anymore, but some ruins have remained, and the crater has been abandoned like a deep pit full of mosquitoes and giant rats, without forgetting the monkeys. However, it does have fantastic flora and fauna. The video below depicts the remained vineyard's ruins and the crater:
