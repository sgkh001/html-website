          One of the famous natural tourist attractions in Mauritius is the Trou aux Cerfs dormant volcano located about 1 kilometer from the town of Curepipe. The dormant, volcanic crater is around 605 meters above sea level, with a diameter of 350 meters and a depth of around 100 meters. Interestingly, Trou aux Cerfs is also called ‘Murr’s Volcano’.
