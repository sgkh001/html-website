        As the name implies, the Eureka Falls are situated close to the famous colonial mansion, Eureka Mansion, which can be found in Moka. A tour of the mansion itself is bound to be a memorable experience, with antique colonial treasures found throughout the gorgeous building which is enhanced by a sensational and exotic garden.

        The Eureka Waterfalls are a short distance from the mansion itself, and a trip down to them, although a slightly challenging path, is well worth the effort for those who are able. At the end of the path, you will actually find four waterfalls, set amongst mango trees and palms and an array of other sublime tropical flora'. The river banks are the natural habitats for water lilies, 'jacinte d'eau', 'bredes songes'. Under the water surface an intense marine life goes on for the 'scampi, madame Céré' (name derived from the wife of the governor Céré), tilapias, carp and eels which can be found in large quantities.
