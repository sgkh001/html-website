      <p> The La Marie road that leads to Mare Aux Vacoas reservoir is calm, and you usually feel a cold wave, particularly when driving. Continuing the road, it passes by Plaine Sophie Nature Walk and goes to Pétrin. You will find a small roundabout on the right that leads to the splendid village of Chamarel. Straight you will descend to Mont Blanc. After several zigzag turns, reach the mysterious crater lake of Bassin Blanc.

        Bassin Blanc has a reputation for being a spooky, dark, and dangerous place. There were several corpses discovered there. They were involved in murders and suicides. One of the famous cases was in 2002. Two people were found in the lake, tied to each other, which has caused controversies on the real cause of death, whether it was a suicide or murder.

        Bassin Blanc’s last eruption was 20,000 years ago, and an extinct volcano. It is 450m above sea-level approximately. There is a thick forest around it. The exact depth of the crater lake is still unknown. Some scholars say around 20m deep. However, the real figure is unknown. The track to descend to the crater is tricky, and one can get easily lost. When you reach the edge of the cone, you can see from the top the immense amount of trees at the bottom. To reach the lake, there is a high possibility to walk in thick mud, depending on the weather, challenging the dense bushes, and end at the lake. Verily, the atmosphere at the bottom is creepy, similar to a horror movie.
