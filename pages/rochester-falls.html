        The iconic Rochester Falls is located in the Savanne district of Mauritius, just some 2.5 kilometers away from Souillac (South of Mauritius). It is also known as the widest waterfall in Mauritius. This majestic waterfall is set in an isolated, wild and lush green area where you can find unique and dramatic cliff faces which have been transformed into jagged rectangular blocks by the force of powerful water over the past hundreds of years.

      <p>The cascading waters tumble from a height of 10 meters through the rocky beds of the Savanne River and form a thick foam.</p>

        Mesmerizing as it may seem, this spectacular spot serves as an ideal spot for a quick refreshing plunge or a small picnic break.
        The breathtaking scenery, cascading waterfalls, pools of clear water, and luxuriant greeneries surrounding the region, makes it a wonderful site to see and a relaxing experience. You might also meet some daring and adventurous locals who are willing to jump from high above the cliffs to the pool of water which is extremely dangerous and definitely not recommended.
